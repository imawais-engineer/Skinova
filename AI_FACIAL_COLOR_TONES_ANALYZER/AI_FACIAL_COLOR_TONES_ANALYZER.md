## Integration Guide

- How to Take Photos for AI Facial Color Tones Analyzer

Take a selfie facing forward

  - Just one clear shot, looking straight into the camera. Leave your hair down so it falls over your chest, and make sure you're staring directly ahead for that front-on view.
  - Instead, use the JS Camera Kit to take a photo. Just leave your hair down so it falls over your chest. Don't tie it up.
- How to Detect Skin Concerns by AI


1. **Resize your source image**

    Resize your photo to fit the supported dimensions. See details in **[File Specs & Errors](https://docs.perfectcorp.com/reference/ai_skin_tone_analysis#section/overview/File-Specs-and-Errors)**

2. **Upload file using the File API**

    Using the _**v2.0/file/skin-tone-analysis**_ API to upload a target user image.

   - Image Requirements

     - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](https://docs.perfectcorp.com/reference/ai_skin_tone_analysis#section/overview/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.
   - _**Important**_: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.

      Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a _**file\_id**_ in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.


     > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown\_internal\_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.
3. **Run an AI Facial Color Tones Analyzer task**

    Once your upload is complete, the AI will use your file ID to examine the color tones of your lips, eyes, eyebrows, skin, and hair. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](https://docs.perfectcorp.com/reference/ai_skin_tone_analysis#section/overview/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.

    Subsequently, calling POST 'task/skin-tone-analysis' with the File ID executes the enhance task and obtains a _**task\_id**_.

4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**

    This _**task\_id**_ is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/skin-tone-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.

**Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's retention period is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).


> **Warning:** You will get a _**InvalidTaskId**_ error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the retention period until the status become either _success_ or _error_.

5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**

    The task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst\_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image. Your units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.

    When deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.

## Inputs & Outputs

- Inputs The AI will analyse the color tones of your skin. You may adjust the `face_angle_strictness_level` to control the checking strictness of the input face angle, ranging from strict, high, medium, low to flexible. The strictness level applies to face angle detection, including pitch, yaw and roll. A stricter level ensures more accurate face attribute results. The default setting is high.

## JS Camera Kit

# JavaScript Camera Kit SDK Documentation

```
version: v2.5
```

## Overview

The **JavaScript Camera Kit** provides a complete in-browser camera solution designed for high-accuracy face-based imaging tasks. It handles camera permissions, real-time face detection, automatic quality validation (lighting, pose, angle, distance), and guided capture UI flows.

This module is optimized for **AI-driven image analysis**, such as:

- AI Skin Analysis (SD/HD)
- AI Face Tone Analysis
- Hair-related Analysis
- Virtual Try-On (Ring, Wrist, Necklace, etc.)

### Key Features

- **Permission Handling:** Automatic management of webcam access.
- **Quality Validation:** Real-time monitoring of face position, lighting, and angle.
- **Multi-Step Flows:** Support for complex capture requirements (e.g., multi-angle hair capture).
- **Flexible Output:** Supports both `base64` and `blob` image formats.

* * *

## Installation

Include the SDK via CDN in your HTML `<head>` or before the closing `<body>` tag. Once loaded, the SDK installs a global `YMK` object.

```
<script src="https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.5-camera-kit/sdk.js"></script>
```

* * *

## Quick Start Example

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the kit, open the camera, and handle captured images.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Camera Kit Sample</title>
    <style>
      #YMK-module { margin: 20px 0; }
      img { width: 150px; margin: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- Initialization Script -->
    <script>
      // Define async init entry point
      window.YMKAsyncInit = function() {
        YMK.addEventListener('loaded', function() {
          console.log('Module fully loaded and ready');
        });

        YMK.addEventListener('faceDetectionCaptured', function(capturedResult) {
          const container = document.getElementById('captured-results');
          container.innerHTML = '';

          // Handle multiple images if returned (e.g., multi-angle capture)
          for (const item of capturedResult.images) {
            const img = document.createElement('img');
            // Handle both base64 strings and Blob objects
            img.src = typeof item.image === 'string'
              ? item.image
              : URL.createObjectURL(item.image);
            container.appendChild(img);
          }
        });
      };

      function openCameraKit() {
        YMK.init({
          faceDetectionMode: 'makeup',
          imageFormat: 'base64',
          language: 'enu'
        });
        YMK.openCameraKit();
      }
    </script>

    <!-- Load SDK -->
    <script src="https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.5-camera-kit/sdk.js"></script>

    <!-- UI Elements -->
    <button onclick="openCameraKit()">Open Camera Kit</button>

    <!-- Mandatory Mount Point -->
    <div id="YMK-module"></div>

    <h3>Captured Results:</h3>
    <div id="captured-results"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

* * *

## Prerequisites

To ensure successful integration, the following requirements must be met:

| Requirement | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Browser Support** | Must support `getUserMedia` API. |
| **HTTPS** | Required on most browsers for webcam access (except localhost). |
| **Mount Point** | A `<div id="YMK-module"></div>` is mandatory for rendering the UI. |
| **Async Init** | You must define `window.YMKAsyncInit` before the SDK loads. |

* * *

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Initialize the Module

Call `YMK.init()` before calling `YMK.openCameraKit()`.

```
YMK.init({
  faceDetectionMode: 'makeup', // Detection flow
  imageFormat: 'base64',       // Output format
  language: 'enu'              // UI Language
});
```

### Step 2: Add Event Handlers

Register listeners for camera events and capture results.

```
YMK.addEventListener('faceQualityChanged', function(q) {
  console.log('Quality updated:', q);
});
```

### Step 3: Open Camera Kit

This displays the UI, opens the webcam, and begins real-time monitoring.

```
YMK.openCameraKit();
```

### Step 4: Receive Captured Results

Images arrive via the `faceDetectionCaptured` event.

```
YMK.addEventListener('faceDetectionCaptured', function(result) {
  console.log(result.images);
});
```

### Step 5: Close Module

Clean up resources when done.

```
YMK.close();
```

### Camera Kit Quality Configuration

Camera Kit provides configurable quality parameters to control face detection and skin analysis behavior. These parameters allow developers to fine-tune detection strictness while maintaining consistency across web and native SDK implementations.

To simplify configuration, Camera Kit includes three predefined presets:

- **RELAXED**: Optimized for usability with minimal restrictions
- **MODERATE**: Balanced between usability and accuracy
- **STRICT**: Optimized for maximum detection accuracy

All custom configurations must meet or exceed the minimum requirements defined by the **RELAXED** preset.

Camera Kit Quality Configuration supports both `skincare` and `hdskincare`.

* * *

### Preset Behavior

| Preset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RELAXED | Less strict validation for smoother user experience |
| MODERATE | Balanced validation for most use cases |
| STRICT | Tight validation for high accuracy scenarios |

When using `qualityOverrides`, you may specify only the parameters you want to change. Unspecified parameters fall back to the active preset defaults.

* * *

| `unsupportedResolution` | Fired when the device resolution does not meet the minimum requirements for the selected mode. |

### Detection Events

#### `faceQualityChanged`

Fires continuously during detection as quality metrics update.

**Example Payload:**

```
{
  "hasFace": true,
  "position": "good",
  "frontal": "good",
  "lighting": "ok"
}
```

**Field Definitions:**

- `hasFace`: (`boolean`) Whether a face is detected.
- `position`: (`string`) Face distance/size quality (`"good"`, `"notgood"`, `"toosmall"`, `"outofboundary"`).
- `frontal`: (`string`) Whether user is facing forward (`"good"`, `"notgood"`).
- `lighting`: (`string`) Lighting strength (`"good"`, `"ok"`, `"notgood"`).

#### `faceDetectionCaptured`

Fired **after** all required face quality validation checks have passed and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow. Depending on the mode, this may contain one or multiple images.

**Example Payload:**

```
{
  "mode": "makeup",
  "images": [\
    {\
      "phase": 0,\
      "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",\
      "width": 500,\
      "height": 500\
    }\
  ]
}
```

**Image Object Fields:**

- `phase`: (`integer`) Zero-based index representing the capture step.
- `image`: (`string` \| `Blob`) The captured image data.
- `width`: (`integer`) Pixel width of the captured image.
- `height`: (`integer`) Pixel height of the captured image.

* * *

## Configuration Notes

### Quality Requirements

To ensure successful capture:

1. **Distance:** Ensure correct face distance (not too zoomed in/out).
2. **Angle:** Ensure frontal face angle.
3. **Lighting:** Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows or dark environments).

### Multi-Phase Capture

Modes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require multiple steps:

1. Front face
2. Turn right
3. Turn left

Ensure your event handling logic accounts for multiple images in the `faceDetectionCaptured` result array.

### Advanced Configuration

- **Flip Button:** Use `hideFlipCameraButton: true` to enforce a specific camera orientation if your UX requires it.
- **Capture Delay:** Adjust `countingDuration` (default `800`) to give users more time to review the capture before auto-submission occurs.

### Minimum Recommended Quality

```
const minQuality = {
  hasFace: true,
  area: "good",
  frontal: "good",
  lighting: "ok"
};
```
